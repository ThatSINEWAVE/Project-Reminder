DocTrack is a web app designed to help Romanian citizens track official documents (ID card, driver's license, etc.) and receive expiration reminders. It is focused on **mobile use**, and the desktop UI may experience issues at this time. The app is currently in **alpha stage** and under active development, so it is **not recommended for real-world use yet**.
